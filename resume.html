		                        <strong>Project Details: </strong>
		                        This project was done for a web design class, and was
		                        my first time using Bootstrap. This project was for the
		                        web design class, so it was more for the art people and
		                        front end development, but it was still very helpful to
		                        see how front end development is done. I had a backend
		                        to this project working with separate users and
		                        instances that created a profile page and running log,
		                        but that was stopped by the professor because he didn’t
		                        have a server and couldn’t access anything html related.
		                        The site was both responsive, and clean in design which
		                        earned high marks in the class and the respect of the
		                        professor who is a free-lance web designer.

		                        view on), Security (sensitive user data had been run
		                        through a hash function as well as *** was used for
		                        password entry)

		                        <strong>Project Details: </strong>
		                        This project was given in 4 small sections that build
		                        upon each other. We had to deal with our decisions from
		                        the past projects in order to finish the current
		                        project, or decide if it was worth it to go back and
		                        rewrite some of it. We were given the freedom to choose
		                        which language we worked in. I chose Java because I
		                        want to get into Software development and I hadn’t used
		                        the language in almost a year. The first part of the
		                        Project is a command line interface, the second is a
		                        Process Control Block, the third is a Scheduler (Round
		                        Robin, FIFO, MLFQ), and the fourth part deal with
		                        memory Segmentation.

		    <strong>Summer 2015 </strong>
		    <strong>Dutchman’s Daughter (Dishwasher) -</strong>
		    This job was part time and was only for the summer while in high school
		    during the summer. I never once called off and was always punctual arriving
		    and stayed late as needed.

		    <strong>Bridgeport Health Care Center (Dietary Assistant)</strong>
		    – My current job requires more attention to detail and being sure each
		    resident is properly cared for. Replenishing stock being sure to have all
		    dishes cleaned and sanitized for each meal, and helping plate the food in a
		    desirable manner for each resident were responsibilities performed. I have
		    only called off 1 shift and that was because of strep throat which could
		    have been transferred to the residents so it would be unethical to work
		    until the condition was resolved. There were many mornings I was called in
		    around midnight the night before and had to be at work at 6AM to cover
		    someone’s shift. I feel that this job has shown my reliability as well as
		    attention to detail and ability to work with others as my duties frequently
		    were working with the cook.

		    <strong>Fusion Technologies (Intern)</strong>
		    - I am currently working with Fusion Technologies doing agile web
		    development using the MVC model with the Spring framework. I am performing
		    tasks to update an in house use website while my government clearance is
		    being run. I am also in Scrum meetings and weekly calls to stay informed
		    with the program as well as our team.
